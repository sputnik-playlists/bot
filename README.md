# Sputnik Music Spotify Playlists

Generate Spotify playlists based on Sputnik Music charts and new releases.

# Usage

## 1.

Create a Spotify app - https://developer.spotify.com

You must also specify a valid Redirect URI in your app settings to:

```
http://localhost:8080/success
```

## 2.

Rename `docker-compose.override.example.yml` to `docker-compose.override.yml`
and add `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET` and `CALLBACK` values.

eg:

```
CLIENT_ID=123456789abcdefghijklmnophijklmn
CLIENT_SECRET=123456789abcdefghijklmnophijklmn
CALLBACK=http://localhost:8080/success
```

## 3.

Install dependencies:

```
docker-compose run --rm node yarn install
```

## 4.

Authorise your app. First, start the auth server.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

1. Browse to `http://localhost:8080`, follow the provided link.
2. Authorise the app
3. You should be redirected to a success message.

## 5.

Generate a token:

```
docker-compose run --rm node node token.js
```

You can regenerate expired tokens:

```
docker-compose run --rm node node refresh.js
```

## 6.

Configure `playlists.json`. See configuration documentation below.

## 7.

Run the bot:

```
docker-compose run --rm node node app.js
```

# Playlist Configuration

Playlists are structered within an array of playlist objects.

## `name`

Name of the playlist. Simples.

## `user`

Your Spotify username.

## `gid`

Genre ID from Sputnik Music. You can find the `gid` of a genre by viewing the
source HTML of the genre select form element.

## `pid`

Period ID from Sputnik Music for `chart` collections. You can find the `pid` of
a `chart` collection by viewing the source HTML of the period (date) select
form element.

## `type`

Playlist types are broken into either a `release` or a `chart`. A `release`
represents a "new release" collection. A `chart` represents a "chart"
collection.

## `rating`

Optionally specify a rating for album selection. An album that is lower than the
specified rating will not be included in the Spotify playlist.

## Mailgun Support

You can send reports via [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com) after the
bot has run.

Configure the following in `config.json`:

```
{
  "mail": {
    "enable": true,
    "apiKey": "<api-key>",
    "domain": "<domain>",
    "from": "<from>",
    "to": "<to>",
    "subject": "<to>"
  }
}
```
